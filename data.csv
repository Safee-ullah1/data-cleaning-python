https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/1699682043-idf-al-shifa-hospital-hit-by-terrorists-misfire,"The Al-Shifa hospital, the biggest medical facility in the Gaza Strip, was hit on Friday.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the attack originated from a misfire by a terrorist organization targeting the IDF troops in the vicinity of the hospital.
The IDF Spokesperson Avichay Adraee stated: ""The analysis conducted by the IDF's operational systems indicates that sabotage elements fired rockets targeting the IDF forces operating near Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. According to IDF systems, rocket-propelled grenades hit the hospital.""
He concluded that ""according to the information available to the IDF, terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip are responsible for the failed missile launch that hit the hospital.""
Additionally, a senior Israeli security official told NBC News that ""at least one strike at Al-Shifa Hospital was from a projectile launched by a militant group inside Gaza that had misfired.""
Earlier last week the IDF also calimed that Al-Shifa hospital is the epicenter of Hamas headquarters in the Strip. Intense combat was reported near the hospital on Friday, it so now said to be surrounded by the IDF.
WSJ cited an unnamed Israeli official stating that there may be Israeli hostages under the medical facility.
In a similar incident on October 17, an explosion occurred at the Al-Ahli Baptist hospital in Gaza. The IDF investigation proved that the blast at the facility was caused by a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).
This was later confirmed by the intelligence services of other countries. Despite that, Palestinian Authorities blamed Israel for the tragedy, which caused a wave of anti-Israel protests, primarily across the the Middle East.",FALSE

Israel’s military has claimed Hamas operates at al-Shifa, which the armed group and hospital officials have denied.
Israel has attacked four hospitals in Gaza, including the enclave’s biggest medical complex, resulting in what appear to be multiple casualties, the health ministry in the Hamas-governed enclave has said.
Israel’s military struck a yard at the al-Shifa Hospital complex, where thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering, health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Friday.
Israel is now undertaking these dangerous steps against the hospitals to put them completely out of commission and subsequently displace the people sheltering in them, as well as the patients and medics,” al-Qudra told Al Jazeera.
Israel’s military has said that Hamas operates a command centre at the site of the hospital, including entrances to its extensive tunnel network, which Hamas and hospital officials have denied.
Israeli officials did not immediately comment on reports of the latest strikes.
Mohammad Abu Salmiya, director general of al-Shifa Hospital, said the strike hit civilians located next to a number of journalists in the yard, wounding four, including two critically.
“This led to a lot of casualties, including critical injuries. It could have been a massacre in this place because of the number of people in this complex,” Abu Salmiya told Al Jazeera.
“Before that, they bombed a building very close to the hospital. And now, there are heavy clashes and heavy bombing next to the hospital.”
Abu Salmiya said that medics and patients were in a state of fear due to near-constant explosions near the facility.
“Not a second goes by without bombing close to the hospital. Many of the hospital’s windows have been broken, and there is fear and anxiety amongst the medics and the patients and the displaced people,” he said.
“This is a war against the hospitals and a war against all the [Palestinian] citizens.”
Video of the apparent aftermath of the attack showed several people screaming and scrambling for cover, and an injured man lying on the pavement in a pool of blood.
Al-Qudra said that two children’s hospitals, al-Rantisi and al-Nasser, had also been hit by “direct attacks and bombardments” on Friday.
Indonesia’s foreign ministry also reported that explosions overnight damaged the Indonesian Hospital, which sits at the northern end of the enclave with thousands of wounded and displaced Palestinians sheltering nearby.
“Indonesia once again condemns the savage attacks on civilians and civilian objects, especially humanitarian facilities in Gaza,” the ministry said in a statement.
Holding up missile shrapnel, Atef al-Kahlout, the hospital’s director, said: “This is what the occupation is throwing at hospitals: missile shrapnel.
“Let the world bear witness to what the occupation targets are. In 24 hours, the hospital will be out of service. It seems the Israeli occupation forces are not happy with the persistence of the Indonesian Hospital nor the steadfastness of the people of northern Gaza.”
Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine director, said on social media that medical facilities must be protected and that “no area is a free-fire zone”.
The attack on al-Shifa is the latest in a series of reported strikes on or near the Gaza City hospital in recent days.
Last week, Israel’s military bombed an ambulance outside the hospital, killing 15 people, according to Palestinian officials.
On Monday, Al Jazeera and Palestinian media reported that Israeli forces had struck solar panels providing electricity to the medical complex, prompting denials by Israeli officials.
Israeli military officials have released pictures, illustrated maps and audio recordings that they say show that Hamas is using the facility to plan operations and hide its fighters.

It's the biggest delivery of supplies since the start of the conflict but Oxfam pointed out it would not be ""nearly enough"".Despite the ceasefire, videos circulated on social media that appear to show Palestinians being shot at as they tried to head from the south of Gaza to the north of the Strip. The Israeli military had advised people against heading north, saying ""the humanitarian pause is temporary, and the northern region of Gaza is a war zone"".Meanwhile the ""catastrophic"" situation at Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital continues, according to a surgeon there. Israeli troops had moved in last week claiming Hamas operates out of the hospital - which it denies.

https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/statement-telecommunications-blackout-gaza,"We have lost all communication with our Anera Gaza staff members. Most with connections in Gaza have lost complete contact with loved ones and colleagues, as destruction has impacted landline, cellular and internet services. As of this morning, our staff were all accounted for, but this is no longer a guarantee. Over the past 21 days, our 12-member team in Gaza has worked tirelessly to provide for their community by serving meals, delivering medicines to hospitals, and sanitizing shelters to prevent disease spread. While we were never able to properly ensure their safety during this unprecedented bombing campaign, we were always able to verify their locations and provide what little protection we could for them. That is now gone.
Equally important, essential services such as ambulance dispatches, hospital communications and rescue operations cannot communicate with one another. Even if medical and aid workers can reach those in need there is no way to confirm where they can be taken to provide life-saving care. We only expect these essential services to become even more vital as we receive reports of a potential ground incursion into the northern areas of Gaza.
This total blackout comes as Gaza’s health and water sectors have collapsed. Without fuel and due to damage from airstrikes, hospitals and healthcare clinics across Gaza have already been forced to shut down or severely reduce their services. Doctors are making horrifying decisions as to which of their emergency patients they can realistically treat. In Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital, doctors reported days ago that the hospital is well over capacity, serving some 5,000 patients when it was originally designed to serve 700 people at a time. This number has surely risen. Medical staff are providing treatment and performing operations on the floors and in hallways, often without anesthesia or proper equipment and sanitation. The hospital is also hosting around 50,000 internally displaced persons. And now, today, we are horrified to hear increasing calls to evacuate and bomb Shifa Hospital.
Anera calls for an immediate ceasefire, as UN members have now called for, and the protection of civilians and the humanitarians who care for them, in the medical and broader aid fields. We ask you to join us in demanding an end to this decimation of life and humanity and to allow life-saving humanitarian aid into Gaza. Please, now more than ever, people in Gaza need your support.",TRUE
https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-51-enarhe,"The humanitarian pause, agreed upon by Israel and Hamas, which took effect on 24 November, has been largely maintained for the third consecutive day. This pause has enabled the UN to enhance the delivery of assistance into and across Gaza.
On 26 November, aid convoys reached areas north of Wadi Gaza (hereafter: the north). UN agencies and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) distributed 1,062 metric tonnes (MT) of ready-to-eat food to four UNRWA shelters in Jabalia camp; 185 MT of tents and blankets and 890 MT of bottled water to various sites; as well as 164 MT of medical supplies to Al Ahli hospital in Gaza city. The convoys were carefully inspected by Israeli forces deployed at a checkpoint near Wadi Gaza before proceeding northwards.
The mission that reached Al Ahli Baptist Hospital evacuated at least 17 patients and wounded people, along with 11 of their companions, to the European Hospital in Khan Younis (in the south). Despite enormous shortages and constraints, Al Ahli remains operational and admitting patients.
Aid distribution in areas south of Wadi Gaza, where the bulk of an estimated 1.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) are currently staying, has been accelerated over the past three days. Key service providers, including hospitals, water and sanitation facilities, and IDP shelters, have continued receiving fuel on a daily basis to operate generators.
Over the past three days, cooking gas has entered Gaza, contrary to the time before the pause. However, the amounts fall well below the needs. Queues at a filling station in Khan Younis have reportedly extended for about 2 kilometres, with people waiting at them overnight. Meanwhile, reports indicate that people are burning doors and window frames to cook.
On 26 November, 17 hostages held in Gaza and 39 Palestinian detainees held in Israeli prisons were released. The released hostages included 13 Israelis – four women and nine children – and four foreign nationals. Among the Palestinian detainees were 39 boys. Since the start of the pause, 39 Israelis, 117 Palestinians and 19 foreign nationals have been released.
Between 25 and 26 November, Israeli forces in the West Bank killed seven Palestinians, including four children, bringing to 230 the Palestinian death toll since 7 October; 222 by Israeli forces and eight by settlers.
Hostilities and casualties (Gaza Strip)

Since the humanitarian pause entered into force at 7:00 on 24 November, airstrikes, shelling, and ground clashes have reportedly ceased.
In one incident involving Israeli tank fire east of the Al -Maghazi refugee camp, in the Middle Area, one Palestinian man was reportedly killed and another injured; the circumstances remain unclear.
According to the Government Media Office, as of 18:00 on 23 November, more than 14,800 people have been killed in Gaza, including about 6,000 children and 4,000 women. This office, which is under the de facto authorities in Gaza, has been reporting casualties since the Ministry of Health in Gaza stopped doing so on 11 November, following the collapse of services and communications at hospitals in the north.
As of 18:00 on 25 November, 75 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the Israeli ground operations, according to official Israeli sources.
Displacement (Gaza Strip)

Upon the entry into force of the pause, Israeli forces announced that the movement of people from the south to the north is forbidden.
On 26 November, the Israeli military continued calling and exerting pressure on residents of the north to leave southwards through a “corridor” along the main traffic artery, Salah Ad Deen Road, between 9:00 and 16:00. OCHA’s monitoring during the day estimated that less than 400 people crossed south.
The OCHA monitoring team observed many people with injuries crossing through the “corridor” on 26 November. A man interviewed by OCHA at the crossing point revealed that they had to leave Kamal Odwan hospital, in the north, after it was hit the night prior to the pause.
Israeli forces had been arresting some people moving through the “corridor.” IDPs interviewed by OCHA reported that Israeli forces had established an unstaffed checkpoint where people are directed from a distance to pass through two structures, where a surveillance system is thought to be installed. IDPs are ordered to show their IDs and undergo into a facial recognition scan.
The movement of unaccompanied children and separated families has also been observed in the “corridor”. Humanitarian actors are assisting these children, including through registration of cases. However, urgent measures are required to augment the presence of child protection teams in shelters; enhancing registration efficiency and addressing the specific needs of these children.
The number of displaced people continues to increase. Over 1.7 million people in Gaza, or nearly 80 per cent of the population, are estimated to be internally displaced. Of them, nearly 927,000 IDPs are sheltering in 99 facilities in the south.
Due to the overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions at UNRWA shelters, there have been significant increases in some communicable diseases and conditions such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections and hygiene-related conditions like lice.
Humanitarian Access (Gaza Strip)

The total number of trucks that entered Gaza on 26 November is unclear at the time of writing as many continued to be processed during the evening hours. On 25 November, 200 trucks were dispatched from Nitzana.
The Rafah crossing with Egypt has been also open on 26 November for the exit of wounded and sick people and dual and foreign nationals, as well as for the entry of Gaza residents who had been stranded in Egypt.
The Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel, which prior to the hostilities was the main entry point for goods, has remained closed.
Electricity

Since 11 October, the Gaza Strip has been under an electricity blackout, after the Israeli authorities cut off the electricity supply, and fuel reserves for Gaza’s sole power plant depleted.
Health care, including attacks (Gaza Strip)

On 26 November, a joint UN convoy collected 7,600 doses of vaccines for various diseases from the Ministry of Health warehouse in Gaza city and transported them to southern Gaza. The need for this transfer arose due to the lack of refrigeration capacity in the north. After thorough inspections to ensure their validity, the vaccines will be utilized to enhance routine immunization, which has been hampered by a shortage of supplies and ongoing hostilities. As of 25 November, 1,205 children were vaccinated at seven health centres according to the national vaccination programme, bringing the total number to 11,622 since 4 November.
Kamal Odwan hospital in Jabalia, one of the four small hospitals still operational in the north, is facing immense pressure. Supplies and medical staff are particularly urgent in the fields of obstetrics, paediatrics, neonatology, surgery, and orthopaedics. Eighty patients require immediate transfer to a better equipped facility in the south for their survival. On 22 November, the vicinity of the hospital was heavily bombarded, reportedly resulting in dozens of fatalities and injuries; many of the latter are still waiting to receive treatment.
Of the 11 medical facilities in the south, eight are currently functional. The bed capacity across Gaza has declined from 3,500 prior to the war to 1,400 as of 20 November, amid a surge in those seeking treatment. Only one of the currently functional hospitals in the south has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 25 November, nine (out of 22) UNRWA health centres were still operational in the south, recording 10,802 patient visits.
Water and sanitation (Gaza Strip)

Since the start of the humanitarian pause, UNRWA has collected and disposed hundreds of tons of solid waste that had been accumulating inside and outside its shelters in the south, benefiting about 1 million people.
On 26 November, technicians visited water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in the north, carrying out an initial assessment of the damage sustained, and the repairs needed to reactivate them.
UNRWA continued delivering fuel to the Gaza’s main water utility, which in turn distributed it to water and sanitation facilities in the south: two seawater desalination plants, 79 water wells, 15 water pumping stations, 18 sewage pumping stations, and one wastewater treatment plant. Supply of potable water in the south via two pipelines coming from Israel has continued.
On 26 November, the first delivery of bottled water reached IDP shelters in the north since the Israeli ground operation began. Partners were previously unable to reach the northern areas due to intense ground operations and lack of fuel for track distribution. However, concerns about dehydration and waterborne diseases persist due to water consumption from unsafe sources, as the water desalination plant and the Israeli pipeline supplying water to the north are not functioning.
Food security

The ready-to-eat food distributed at UNRWA shelters in Jabalia, in the north, on 26 November, included about 7.6 metric tons of high-energy biscuits provided by the World Food Programme (WFP). This covers the minimal daily food intake for 23,616 people for one day.
Since 24 November, WFP has provided essential food assistance to 110,000 people in UNRWA shelters and host communities through the distribution of bread, food parcels, and electronic vouchers. Since 25 November, one WFP bakery has resumed operations on an ad-hoc basis allowing the provision of bread to about 90,000 people in UN shelters in the south.
Food prices in the market have experienced an unprecedented surge. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, during October, food and beverages prices increased by 10 per cent; with vegetables increasing by 32 per cent, wheat flour by 65 per cent, and mineral water by 100 per cent.
Despite the increase in food aid through Rafah, many people still lack food and fuel to cook. No additional bakeries are operational, due to the lack of fuel, water, and wheat flour, and structural damage. Wheat flour is reportedly no longer available in the market. Food Security Cluster members have raised serious concerns about the nutritional status of people, especially lactating women, and children. This is heightened in the north, which is more difficult to reach.
Also in the north, livestock is facing starvation and the risk of death due to shortage of fodder and water. Crops are being increasingly abandoned and damaged due to lack of fuel required to pump irrigation water.
Across Gaza, farmers have been slaughtering their animals due to the immediate need for food and the lack of fodder to keep them alive. This practice poses an additional threat to food security as it leads to the depletion of productive assets.
Hostilities and casualties (Israel)

On 25 November, no rocket fire from Gaza towards Israel was reported. In total, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli authorities, the vast majority on 7 October. As of 20 November, the names of most of these fatalities have been released, including 859 civilians and police officers. Of those whose ages have been provided, 33 are children.
Following the release of 17 hostages on 26 November, 178 people remain captive in Gaza, including Israelis and foreign nationals, according to the Israeli authorities. Before the pause, four civilian hostages had been released by Hamas, one Israeli soldier had been rescued by Israeli forces, and three bodies of hostages had reportedly been retrieved by Israeli forces. On 25 November, the UN reiterated its call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.
Violence and casualties (West Bank)

On 25 and 26 November, Israeli forces shot and killed seven Palestinians, including four children during Israeli forces operations. The deadliest incident, which lasted for ten hours, took place in Jenin Refugee Camp, and resulted in five Palestinians killed. The operation involved armed clashes with Palestinians, and airstrikes, resulting in extensive infrastructure and residential damage. According to medical sources, during the operation, Israeli forces impeded the work of paramedics, denied access to two hospitals, and arrested two people injured in one of the hospitals. Another Palestinian boy was killed by Israeli forces in Al Bireh (Ramallah) during stone throwing confrontations. Another Palestinian man was killed while inside his vehicle during an operation carried out by undercover Israeli forces in Yatma (Nablus). No Israeli casualties were reported.
Since 7 October, 222 Palestinians, including 58 children, have been killed by Israeli forces; and an additional eight, including one child, have been killed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Four Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians.
About 66 per cent of the fatalities since 7 October have occurred during confrontations that followed Israeli search-and-arrest operations, primarily in Jenin and Tulkarm governorates; 24 per cent have been in the context of demonstrations concerning Gaza; seven per cent have been killed while attacking or allegedly attacking Israeli forces or settlers; two per cent have been killed in settler attacks against Palestinians; and one per cent during punitive demolitions.
Since 7 October, Israeli forces have injured 2,904 Palestinians, including at least 369 children, over half of them in the context of demonstrations. An additional 73 Palestinians have been injured by settlers and 18 others either by forces or settlers. Some 33 per cent of those injuries have been caused by live ammunition.
On 25 November, three settler attacks resulted in damage to property and injuries. In one incident, a group of settlers accompanied by Israeli forces broke into Burqa village (Nablus), which was followed by confrontations with Palestinians; Israeli forces opened live fire, injuring one Palestinian. In another two incidents, according to Palestinian eyewitnesses, a group of Israeli settlers vandalized 155 olive trees in the outskirt of Immatin (Qalqiliya) and Qaryut (Nablus).
Since 7 October, OCHA has recorded 284 settler attacks against Palestinians, resulting in Palestinian casualties (34 incidents), damage to Palestinian-owned property (212 incidents), or both casualties and damage to property (38 incidents). This reflects a daily average of almost six incidents, compared with three since the beginning of the year. Over one-third of these incidents included threats with firearms, including shootings. In nearly half of all incidents, Israeli forces were either accompanying or actively supporting the attackers.
Displacement (West Bank)

Since 7 October, at least 143 Palestinian households comprising 1,014 people, including 388 children, have been displaced amid settler violence and access restrictions. The displaced households are from 15 herding/Bedouin communities.
Additionally, 181 Palestinians, including 93 children, have been displaced since 7 October following demolitions in Area C and East Jerusalem, due to lack of permits; and 52 Palestinians, including 25 children, have been displaced following punitive demolitions.
Funding

As of 25 November, Member States have disbursed US$256.4 million against the updated Flash Appeal launched by the UN and its partners to implement its response plan in support of 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 500,000 in the West Bank. This constitutes about 21 per cent of the $1.2 billion requested. An additional $250 million has been pledged by 23 November. Private donations are collected through the Humanitarian Fund.
HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND RESPONSES: 13-19 November

Health

On 18 November, WHO led a joint UN team that visited Shifa Hospital, in Gaza city to conduct a rapid situational analysis, assess medical priorities, and establish logistics options for the evacuation of patients.

Since 1 November, Cluster partners have delivered the following items across Gaza:

various medical supplies to ten hospitals and the ambulances;
assistive and mobility devices, wound dressing kits and first aid kits to 805 people;
87 reproductive health kits to hospitals to enable safe deliveries;
cash transfers to 724 vulnerable women in Gaza, including pregnant and lactating women, breast cancer patients, and survivors of gender-based violence (GBV);
600 postpartum kits;
900 family hygiene kits distributed in one IDP shelter in An-Nusseirat and 120 host community shelters;
1,070 dignity kits to women staying in IDP shelters.
During the same period, there have been an average of 10,000 consultations a day at mobile primary healthcare providers in shelters; 2,925 children were vaccinated after this service resumed in November; 132 wound dressing and 60 physiotherapy sessions were provided. Limited mental health and psychosocial services are being provided by partners, mainly in shelters. Cluster partners are also working to strengthen disease surveillance and early warning systems.

Main factors that have been impeding operations include limited access to the north; shortage of fuel, medical supplies, water, food, and other essential supplies; displacement of partners, their staff and families; and overcrowding in IDP shelters. NGO partners have experienced difficulties with their logistics capacity in Egypt. So far, only 19 per cent of funding required to respond has been committed.

Protection

Mine contamination is already widespread and poses devastating risks for people in Gaza. Despite challenges, during the reporting period, 18 Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) focal points were deployed in UNRWA shelters in the south and will begin awareness raising. The UN Mine Action Service is developing a training course for 20 UNRWA staff in Khan Younis and Rafah. Planning for the expansion of risk education outreach in non-UNRWA shelters is underway. One NGO also reached 4,900 people with risk education about unexploded ordnances and sent 500,000 SMS related messages.

A mapping of GBV-related service providers and responders has been completed. The main priority in this context is to reduce overcrowding in shelters, which increase stressors, reduce privacy, and exacerbate risks of violence towards women and girls. Of concern is the significant gap in dignity kits supplies and access for women of the reproductive age. There are 3,000 kits in Egypt ready to move into Gaza once approved, and a further 6,000 in the pipeline. Funding is urgently needed to meet the soaring needs of women and girls in Gaza.

Cluster partners are assessing needs and available supply of assistive devices and kits in UNRWA southern governorate shelters. While demand for assistive devices continues to increase, the remaining stockpiles in northern Gaza are inaccessible. Further supplies are being procured and in the pipeline via Egypt. Significant damage to rehabilitation facilities has cut critical services.

Mental health care needs are skyrocketing, especially for persons with disabilities, children, and those with pre-existing complex conditions. However, many services have been destroyed and many staff are unable to work. Only limited psychosocial support (PSS) services and psychological first aid is being provided in some shelters across Gaza where protection actors are sheltering and have capacity to respond.

Despite extreme overcrowding at shelters, UNRWA has been able to provide some recreational activities, PSS support, and mine risk awareness sessions. They have also conducted child protection assessments and been assessing how to implement activities with children and young adults and scale up these activities across all their shelters.

Food security

Since 7 October, the World Food Programme (WFP) has reached an estimate of 550,300 IDPs in UN shelters with daily fresh bread, canned food, or date bars. Additionally, food parcels were distributed to 38,659 displaced people in host communities to support their food needs over a 15-day period. In addition, WFP has provided cash-based transfers. In November, redemption rates decreased compared with October, due to the closure of the majority of WFP-contracted shops, stock depletion, or connectivity disturbances preventing assistance activities across Gaza. WFP is piloting a programme relying on the existing electronic voucher platform to distribute food parcels at shops and partner distribution points. Overall, 73.5 WPF truckloads entered Gaza carrying 1,296 metric tons of food assistance. This falls short of meeting the necessary needs of food in the Strip.

In addition to in-kind food distribution, UNRWA has been distributing flour to bakeries for producing bread for distribution. To date, 88 UNRWA trucks containing food entered Gaza, carrying 1,760 metric tons of food assistance.

Twenty international and local NGOs have jointly reached 1,9 million people since the beginning of the war (cumulative). Partners have used different modalities, including food parcels, hot meals and e-vouchers

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)

During the reporting period, WASH Cluster partners delivered the following items. In the absence of safe access to the north, distribution has been made possible in areas south of Wadi Gaza only.

Some 165 cubic metres of bottled water at IDP centres, addressing drinkable water needs of about 100,000 people.
Some 1,733 cubic metres of water through water trucking for hosting communities and IDP centres from the municipal and private desalination plants in the south, addressing the drinking and domestic water needs of 300,000 people (less than 5 litres a day per person).
Four cleaning kits for four IDP centres in Rafah, hosting about 10,000 people.
Some 6,500 family hygiene kits for IDPs (3,800 in the north and 2,700 in the south), serving about 40,000 people.
Additional sanitary units for UNRWA IDPs.
The situation in the north is of extreme concern and the highest priority for the WASH Cluster: the water desalination plant and the Israeli pipeline are not functioning, while there has been no distribution of bottled water among IDPs accommodated in shelters, raising grave concerns about dehydration and waterborne diseases due to water consumption from unsafe sources.

The average water production from all Gaza water sources does not exceed 12 per cent of its usual capacity before the escalation. WASH Cluster issued a document outlines the Water Supply and Fuel Relationship.

WASH partners have secured US$6 million, representing some 15.6 per cent of the need for immediate response to the current situation.

Shelter and Non-Food Items (NFI)

During the reporting period, Shelter Cluster partners delivered the following items. In the absence of safe access to the north, distribution has been made possible in areas south of Wadi Gaza only.

7,600 bedding sets (blankets, mattresses, and mats),
2,000 kitchen sets,
2000 washing kits,
370 tarps, 1000 dignity kits in public schools and buildings, including hospitals,
350 tents donated to UNRWA to decongest overcrowded shelters.
Due to limited supplies, cluster partners only covered less than 7 per cent of the estimated Shelter and NFIs needs.

There is still a major gap in shelter winterization materials and essential NFIs, including sealing off kits for damaged houses and creating additional living spaces; a high shortage in bedding sets, including mattresses and blankets to cover the needs of the IDPs in different settings, including UNRWA shelters; and winterized tents to protect homeless IDPs from harsh weather conditions. 

Education

Since 7 October, eight Education Cluster partners have reached 45,867 students and teachers. The main deliverables included emergency learning and recreational supplies (42,533 people reached), psychosocial support (30,018 reached), and recreational activities (8,082 reached). The response has been focusing on Khan Younis, Rafah, and Middle governorates, as North Gaza and Gaza governorates are inaccessible.

Logistics

16 November marked one month since the activation of the Palestine Logistics Cluster. The Palestine – Gaza Response Operation Overview and One Month Infographic are available on the dedicated operation webpage.

During the reporting period, the entry of limited amounts of fuel for UNRWA has been coordinated, for the first time since the start of hostilities, with regular daily deliveries expected from 19 November. fewer trucks entered Gaza for several days during the week due to a backlog of aid from previous days, shortage of fuel and a communication shutdown leading to an inability to effectively manage or coordinate humanitarian aid convoys under these circumstances.

Three staff members based in Gaza joined the Logistics Cluster to support UNRWA, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and a partner NGO in receiving shipments crossing from Rafah. 

The Logistics Cluster has also conducted a Storage Needs and Capacity Survey in Gaza and Egypt. Results show that about 165,000 cubic metres of storage space is available inside Gaza, the majority of which is in Gaza city and Rafah. Sixteen organizations require storage inside Gaza, while 14 organizations require storage in Egypt. The Logistics Cluster will continue following up with the organizations to ensure needs are met.

Emergency Telecommunications

The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) coordination team continues to engage all parties ― the Egyptian Red Crescent, OCHA, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and the Egyptian authorities ― to fast-track the importation process of telecommunications equipment through either Egypt or Israel into Gaza. Liaison with OCHA continues the importation of equipment into Gaza via Israel. To coordinate a collective approach among partners for the importation of equipment, a survey was launched on 16 November and is currently ongoing. A security communications services implementation plan is being developed.

By Friday, they had advanced about 15km (9.3 miles) from the Gaza-Israel border along the coastal road, adjacent to the Turkey-Palestine Friendship Hospital, well south of Gaza City.

The then-31-year-old mother was with her 3-year-old daughter Sara at the Sbarro restaurant in the heart of downtown Jerusalem located at the Jaffa Road-King George Street intersection, after detonation of a powerful bomb packed with nails by Palestinian Hamas terrorist Izz al-Din Shuheil al-Masri, 22.

Severe injuries left her in a coma from which she never awoke since the day of the attack. Her daughter survived and is today expecting her own third child.

Fatalities of the attack include five members of the Schijveschuurder family, descendants of Dutch Holocaust survivors. Two of the family’s children were among 140 others who were injured. In total, three Americans were among the dead.

The terrorist was a resident of the West Bank town of Aqaba. His remains were eventually handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).

The bombmaker, Abdullah Barghouti, was commander of the West Bank branch of the Hamas Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades Military Wing. In 2003, he received the longest ever sentence in Israeli history – 67 life terms plus 5,200 years behind bars – for involvement in the Sbarro and a series of other notable deadly attacks. The PA has paid the notorious felon a ‘pension’ since his conviction as part of its “Pay to Slay” program that awards payments to Palestinian terrorists and their families dependent on the severity of the crimes against Israelis.

Female accomplice Ahlam Tamimi, a Jordanian and the first woman to join Hamas, was given 16 life sentences in 2003 for her role in the Sbarro bombing, including having driven al-Masri to the scene of the crime. She returned to the Hashemite Kingdom after being freed in 2011 along with 1,026 other Palestinians in a prisoner exchange with Hamas for the return of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.  The United States has long sought Tamimi’s extradition on charges of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against Americans; a request so far rejected by Jordan’s High Court.

The attack was occurred during the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising between September 2000 and January 2005, that claimed the lives of at least 1,010 Israelis.",FALSE

China proposes plan for two-state solution in Israel-Palestine (thecradle.co),"China proposed to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on 30 November to adopt a “concrete” timetable and map for implementing a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. The Far East nation is seeking to achieve a “comprehensive, just, and lasting” resolution to the crisis. A statement issued by China's foreign minister Wang Yi reads, “The current Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused heavy civilian casualties and a serious humanitarian disaster. It is a grave concern of the international community. President Xi Jinping stated China's principled position on the current Palestinian-Israeli situation on a number of occasions.” China laid out its ideas in a five-point plan for the UNSC to end the fighting, effectively protect civilians, ensure humanitarian assistance, enhance diplomatic mediation, and secure a political settlement. The plan would aim to see the “establishment of an independent State of Palestine” based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. Since the beginning of the war between Israel and the Palesinian resistance on 7 October, Beijing has sought de-escalation deals and voiced calls for a two-state solution. On 23 October, Foreign Minister Yi voiced to his Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen his discontent over Israeli actions in Gaza that have killed some 20,000 Palestinians, the majority women and children. “China is deeply concerned about the continued escalation of the conflict and the worsening situation and deeply saddened by the large number of civilian casualties caused by the conflict,” he said. President Xi Jinping said near the start of the war that “the international and regional situation is going through profound and complex changes, and the world is witnessing rapid changes unparalleled in a century."" “The most urgent task now is to stop the war in Gaza in order to avoid the expansion of the conflict,” he added. The Chinese president in June announced that his government and the Palestinian Authority (PA) had established a “strategic partnership,” saying that this affirms China’s willingness to ""play a positive role"" in finding a lasting solution to the Palestinian-Israeli dispute through diplomatic means. President Xi also proposed an international peace conference in June on the Palestine-Israel dispute. “We must adhere to the right direction of the peace talks,” Xi said to President Mahmoud Abbas at the time, and “push for the holding of a larger, more authoritative and more influential international peace conference.” In March, Beijing brokered a historic normalization agreement between West Asian rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran.",

 “It’s a massacre. Thousands of people are out. Thousands. I’ve been there just before two minutes. It could be me,” she said.
 Everyday life in Gaza includes waiting in long lines to use the bathroom, hearing loud explosions throughout the day, and finding or making bread to avoid starving to death.
 “The bread is very old because there’s no bakeries here open since three days,” said Owda in a video.
 Other videos show devastated family members and friends screaming as they hold the deceased bodies of their loved ones. At times, the deceased women and children are missing limbs or their faces are disfigured.
 When these young reporters go silent on their social media, their comments are flooded by concerned people from all around the world.
 They say things like, ““Bisan, please be okay,” and ""Plestia, are you still alive?”

 Before Oct. 7, the social media accounts of these young journalists showed healthier versions of them. There were less, but not zero, depictions of violence and retaliation from the Israel Defense Forces.
 Every day, people from around the world check their accounts for updates and hope they are still alive.",TRUE
https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/bisan-plestia-motaz-gaza-through-my-instagram-feed.html,"isan Owda, or wizard_bisan1, as her 2 million followers know her, was a filmmaker before the assault on Gaza began. In a video from October 12, she offers footage of her prewar office. It looks like a typical millennial media workspace: camcorders, whiteboards, couches, a fluffy cat napping across a desk. She has discovered the office was bombed. “I know it’s not a suitable time to talk about places and homes because people are losing their lives,” she says in the video, her eyes welling. ‘‘People are being killed.” Even within Gaza, there’s a hierarchy of suffering.
 Owda, 25, describes herself as a hakawatieh in her bio. A storyteller. Now, she is suddenly a journalist. In Gaza, the line between civilian and journalist seems irrelevant as neither is safe. In each of her videos, her long dark hair is pulled back, a mess of curls atop her head or behind her in a pouf of a ponytail. She wears braces, an assortment of loose-fitting T-shirts, and denim button-downs. Her live reports vary in tone. In a recent video, she calmly explains what Gaza even is, geographically speaking. That same day, she fights back tears as she describes the lack of food and water. “We are dying because of hunger,” she says, shivering. Some of her videos are in Arabic, but most are in English. That way, from Gaza she can reach the previously unreachable — that is, the West. Every morning, I check my feed in the hopes of finding something from Bisan. My stomach tightens with each scroll until she appears. “I’m still alive,” she usually begins.
 Alongside Owda on Instagram are 22-year-old Plestia Alaqad and 24-year-old Motaz Azaiza, both journalists livestreaming the war. In a video from October 9, Alaqad shows us the view from her neighbor’s balcony. “There is no view,” she says, panning across hazy silhouettes of buildings through the dust. Her shoulder-length hair often blows in the wind created by explosions that you can hear in the background. In Azaiza’s videos, he acknowledges the shame of filming his fellow Gazans during their most devastating moments. In a particularly haunting video, a little boy sits shaking in what appears to be a hospital, though no doctors are present. The camera pans to a boy next to him with a bandaged head and burn marks up and down his arms. The scene plays over and over in my mind.
 These videos have thousands of views. These journalists have followers, many of whom I know, and it’s heartening to see familiar handles in the list. “Just know that you are not alone,” a friend wrote to me in mid-October. As a Palestinian American, that’s how I’ve felt for much of my life. Alone in witnessing, in trying desperately to communicate what’s really going on. My parents emigrated from Nablus in the late ’70s, first to California and then to D.C. I spent my childhood summers visiting Jordan and the West Bank. In the West, I’ve been surrounded by decades of talking points that obscure history and humanity. Decades of labels and terminology like “terrorist” and “the right to defend itself” and “the only democracy in the Middle East.” Decades of unwavering support for our obliteration.“You are not alone.” I hope that’s how Owda, Alaqad, and Azaiza feel, less alone with each like. A Jewish friend in Brooklyn recently mentioned something Motaz had shared, referring to him on a first-name basis. People in New York, where I now live, feel as if they know them. Bisan, Plestia, Motaz are names and faces placed in a category of people who, until now, have been represented only as numbers or else wrapped in keffiyehs, their faces barely visible. That Plestia and Bisan don’t wear hijabs is worth noting. Almost all of the mainstream-media images of women from Gaza include headscarves. The fact that these women look like us, look like me, a Muslim Palestinian, makes them easier to identify with. We come to hold the same expectations for them as we do for ourselves, express the same outrage at the injustice facing them as we would if faced with t
 Western audiences watch their coverage in the form of “news.” We in the diaspora are somewhere in the middle. To us, news is too distant a term. We bear witness while bearing witness to the witnessing of others. We notice who’s saying and doing what, who has remained silent. In fits of frustration, I have unfollowed friends who have continued to post as though no war were happening. We notice who’s sharing, who’s protesting, whose names are on the letters demanding a cease-fire, which petition. I’ve applied an irrational logic. I’ve assessed their pro-Palestinian-ness by how early into the assault they reached out (interestingly, almost all of the early round were Jewish friends). By now, I figure, everyone should be rallying against this, no matter which side of the issue they’re on. I have witnessed childhood friends, friends made before identity and politics entered our consciousness, finally acknowledge Palestinian suffering. “Thank you for sharing this,” they say. I have witnessed friends who thought the issue was complicated realize it isn’t.
 Since the assault began, I’ve spent my days yelling, crying, sharing, fundraising, and continuing on as normal. Bouts of activism interspersed with the daily life of a working mother in Brooklyn. I’ve taught my writing classes as usual without once mentioning Palestine. I’ve walked by the doxing vans and tried to shake off my disgust before entering the classroom. I’ve read at fundraisers and found my voice shaking, eyes burning, even though I’d chosen to read something with levity. Pain in writing can be hilarious, the author Geoff Dyer once told me. As a Palestinian, I’ve held on to that. I’ve gone to action-oriented meetings to organize. I’ve also gone to a dog Halloween-costume contest with my wife and our 1-year-old daughter. I’ve taken her to Tunes for Tykes. That I can grieve and protest, attend vigils and fundraisers, and still plan a birthday party for my daughter is a duality that is impossible to sit with. “Everything normal right now is obscene,” I heard Israeli journalist Amira Hass say early on in the war, and it’s true. Even sitting down to articulate this moment feels obscene.
 As Palestinians in the diaspora, many of us have tried to use our position of straddling two worlds to communicate across cultural lines. That’s what brought me to writing in the first place — first to journalism, then to essays and fiction, where I could subversively get people to identify with characters who shared the same woes but happened to be Palestinian. Now, finally, those inside have a platform. They are the real-life characters. This time, the words aren’t mine to speak.
 “Reporting and posting about what’s happening in Gaza, Palestine feels pointless,” Plestia writes on day 37, having regained access to her account after two days without it. “It feels like I’m posting movie scenes for people to watch, and whenever they get bored they watch something else.” It’s a good point, one that instills shame. At what stage do we become voyeurs? Are people just watching and not witnessing? To watch is to consume; to witness is to acknowledge, to bestow some degree of legitimacy. But what does it do to see it? Is empathy ever enough? “Compassion is an unstable emotion,” Susan Sontag wrote. “It needs to be translated into action, or it withers.” Earlier, I went to share a post and stopped myself. I thought of Motaz’s apology, his shame at filming Gazans in their worst moments. Will a picture of a girl who has lost 60 family members and the use of her legs inspire only empathy? Will it change anything, or will the bombing just continue, the number of orphans and murdered doctors keep rising?
 My uncle’s Gazan wife once told me that during Gaza’s many wars, people would often go to the beach after a bombing to celebrate the fact that they were still alive. Joy is its own form of resistance. It allows people to sustain. I find myself looking for any signs of normalcy among Bisan, Plestia, and Motaz’s images. A makeshift birthday party atop the rubble. Laughter in the long lines of exodus. Sometimes, all I can find is a sunny blue sky. Gaza has long been called an open-air prison, a description I bristle at despite its fully land- and sea-locked status. Its people are not criminals, and to call it a prison is to suggest they deserve what they get. They lead big lives in spite of confinement. Before the war, each of them had a life that, while difficult and dehumanizing, contained joy. In a video from October 4, days before the war began, Bisan is by the beach, upbeat bistro music playing in the background. There is footage of her riding a Jeep through the desert, of Motaz dancing at a graduation, of Plestia sitting beside an electric fireplace in Gaza City, smiling.",TRUE

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67241362,"There's been intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza by air, heavier than in previous evenings, while all internet and phone communications appear to be out in the territory.
 Israel has confirmed its forces are expanding their ground operations.
 The internet monitoring service Netblocks posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, to say there had been a ""collapse in connectivity"".
 The Palestinian Red Crescent says it cannot speak to its teams in Gaza.
 ""We are deeply concerned about the ability of our teams to continue providing their emergency medical services, especially since this disruption affects the central emergency number '101',"" they wrote in a post on X.
 Meanwhile sirens alerted people in southern Israel to rocket fire from Gaza.
 On Friday, the Israeli military again told Gaza City citizens to move south after announcing the expansion of its military operation.
 In a press conference, spokesman Daniel Hagari said the military had ""increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly"".
 ""In continuation of the offensive activity we carried out in the last few days, the ground forces are expanding the ground activity this evening.""
 Currently we can't get hold of people in Gaza with communications still down.
 For example the BBC tried to send a WhatsApp message at 6.40pm local (nearly three hours ago) - it still just has a single tick meaning it hasn't been received by the person's phone.
 Mobile phone call attempts just get an unobtainable message.
 We've had the same for several other call attempts - messages and calls aren't going through.
 BBC Arabic reporter Mehdi Musawi tried to reach journalists and health officials in Gaza all day and could only get short replies on WhatsApp. Eventually, they got through to Gaza's Al Shifa hospital, but by evening all lines of communication were down.
 By then, live footage showed complete darkness across the region. The reporter sent messages to everyone he had spoken to earlier in the day - but they did not deliver.
 The panic and anxiety is spreading within the Palestinian diaspora.
 For the past 20 days, sporadic, limited exchanges on WhatsApp have brought occasional moments of respite.
 However, any extended gap in communication has been met with paralysing anxiety - marked by questions like: ""Are they dead, are they alive, was their house bombed too?""
 In one WhatsApp group relatives from around the world have been frantically messaging since the blackout.
 ""Oh my god!!"" one wrote.
 ""It seems a ground offensive may start,"" wrote another.
 The near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza risks providing cover for ""mass atrocities"", Human Rights Watch said.
 ""This information blackout risks providing cover for mass atrocities and contributing to impunity for human rights violations,"" the group's senior technology and human rights researcher, Deborah Brown, said in a statement.
 The Palestinian telecoms provider Jawwal says there is a ""complete interruption of all communication and internet services with the Gaza strip in light of the ongoing aggression,"" which it says has cut the ""last of the international routes"" connecting Gaza to the outside world.
 We've asked the Israeli military to comment on the communications outage but so far they have not responded.",TRUE
https://www.euronews.com/2023/10/29/israel-strikes-near-gazas-largest-hospital-after-accusing-hamas-of-using-it-as-a-base,"Palestinian Red Crescent: Israeli strikes damaged Gaza hospital
 The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has announced that Israeli strikes on Sunday damaged sections in the packed Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, after receiving two phone calls from the Israeli military to evacuate.
 
 A video the Red Crescent posted on X, formerly Twitter, of the hospital following the strikes shows rooms covered in debris and dust and the windows blown out. People covered their noses and mouths, panicking as they tried to leave the hospital with their children.
 
 The PRCS-run hospital administration said that evacuating the hospital was impossible, as its hundreds of patients included children in incubators and wounded people in the intensive-care unit. In a statement, it said many of the 14,000 people seeking shelter there are Palestinians displaced by the ongoing Hamas-Israel war.Israeli strikes targeted areas around the hospital throughout Sunday. The director-general of the World Health Organization has previously said that it would be “impossible” to evacuate hospitals without endangering people’s lives.Hamas reports 'violent fighting' with Israeli army in northern Gaza
 Hamas has reported ""violent fighting"" underway between its fighters and Israeli forces in the north of the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli army has been carrying out ground incursions since Friday evening.
 
 “Our fighters are currently engaged in heavy combat using automatic and anti-tank weapons with the occupation forces carrying out an incursion into the northwest of Gaza,” said the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, in a statement.
 
 The al-Qassam brigades also announced shortly beforehand that they had fired ""mortar shells and rockets"" at an Israeli military position in Erez, the main crossing point between the Palestinian territory and Israel, closed since the start of the war
 
 Number of children killed in conflict soars
 The number of children killed in the blockaded Gaza Strip since the start of the Hamas-Israel earlier this month has exceeded the number of children killed in armed conflict every year globally since 2019, international charity Save the Children has announced. 
 
 
 In a statement, the charity cited numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry of at least 3,195 children killed in the war. It also mentioned the deaths of 33 children in the occupied West Bank and 29 children killed in Israel.
 
 “The numbers are harrowing and with violence not only continuing but expanding in Gaza right now, many more children remain at grave risk,” Save the Children Country Director in the occupied Palestinian territory Jason Lee said in a statement. “One child’s death is one too many, but these are grave violatUN Secretary General renews calls for humanitarian cease-fire
 UN Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that “the world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes” in Gaza, with over two million people denied the essentials of life and subjected to relentless bombardment.
 
 “I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink,” he told reporters at a meeting with Nepal’s prime minister in Kathmandu on Sunday. “We must join forces to end this nightmare for the people of Gaza, Israel and all those affected around the world.”
 
 The UN chief reiterated his appeal for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, the unconditional release of all hostages and delivery of aid at scale to Gaza.
 
 Guterres again condemned Hamas’ “appalling attacks” on Israel on 7 October, stressing that “there is no justification, ever, for the killing, injuring and abduction of civilians.”
 
 He also reiterated that all parties to conflict are required under international humanitarian laws to protect civilians and provide them with food, water, medicine and other essentials, stressing that “those laws cannot be contorted for the sake of expedience.”
 
 “The number of civilians who have been killed and injured is totally unacceptable,” Guterres added.
 
 Israel drops leaflets on Gaza, asking civilians to 'surrender'
 Israel’s military, which has said repeatedly that it is not at war with civilians in Gaza but rather with Hamas, dropped leaflets on the Gaza Strip Sunday asking civilians to “surrender.” Written in Arabic, the leaflets told civilians to lay down all their weapons, put their hands up, wave white flags and follow instructions from the Israeli military.
 
 “Hamas leaders are exploiting you,” the flyers read. “They and their families are in safe places, while you die in vain.”
 
 Washington calls on Israel to make 'distinction' between Hamas and Palestinian civilians
 
 The United States said on Sunday that Israel must make a ""distinction"" in its military operations between Hamas and Palestinian civilians, as the Israeli army intensifies its bombings and ground operations in the Gaza Strip.
 
 “What we believe is that every hour, every day of this military operation, the Israeli government should take every possible measure at its disposal to distinguish between Hamas – terrorists who are legitimate military targets – and civilians who are not,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN.
 
 Hamas militants killed near Erez crossing - Israel
 Israel’s military have claimed that ground forces killed a number of Hamas militants as they were exiting a tunnel near the Erez crossing, which used to be the sole pedestrian passageway out of the coastal enclave into Israel before it was destroyed in the fighting. It was unclear how many militants were killed by Israeli forces.
 
 Videos of the ground operation released by the military showed tanks traversing small, sandy hills and bulldozers clearing mountains of debris. Hamas has a sprawling network of tunnels underneath Gaza where it is believed to be stockpiling weapons, food, and other supplies.
 
 
 Sunak and Macron insist on the need for 'urgent humanitarian support' - Downing Street
 
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s office says he has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron about the importance of getting urgent humanitarian support into Gaza and maintaining regional security following the expansion of Israel’s military operation against Hamas.
 
 The leaders “agreed to work together on efforts both to get crucial food, fuel, water and medicine to those who need it, and to get foreign nationals out,” Downing Street said in a statement on Sunday.
 
 “They expressed their shared concern at the risk of escalation in the wider region, in particular in the West Bank. The Prime Minister and President Macron updated on the conversations they have had with leaders in the region to stress the importance of working to ensure regional stability,” the statement added.
 
 Sunak and Macron agreed that it was important not to lose sight of the long-term future of the region and, in particular, the need for a two-state solution, the statement said, adding, ""They underscored that Hamas does not represent ordinary Palestinians and that their barbarism should not undermine the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.”
 
 Pope calls for cease-fire and release of hostages
 Pope Francis repeatedly called for a cease-fire in Gaza on Sunday.
 
 “Let’s continue to pray for Ukraine and for the serious situation in Palestine and Israel and for other regions with wars,” Francis said.
 
 “In particular, in Gaza, leave space to guarantee humanitarian aid. And let the hostages be freed immediately. Let no one abandon the possibility to stop the arms. Cease fire,” he added, speaking from the window of the Apostolic Palace above St. Peter’s Square.
 
 The pope cited the Reverend Ibrahim Faltas, the vicar of the Custody the Holy Land, as joining him in the urgent plea for a cease-fire.
 
 “Stop yourselves brothers and sisters, war is always defeat. Always! Always!” he concluded.
 
 Netanyahu apologises after criticising security officials
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has apologised after criticising security officials for having underestimated the risks of a major Hamas attack.
 
 He posted a message on X - formerly Twitter - which he later deleted before apologising.
 
 “Never, under any circumstances, has the Prime Minister been alerted to the warlike intentions of Hamas,” Netanyahu wrote on X (formerly Twitter).
 
 ""All security officials, including the head of military intelligence and the head of internal security, believed that Hamas was afraid to act and was seeking an arrangement. This is the assessment that was submitted several times to the prime minister and to the cabinet by all security officials and the intelligence community. Until the moment the war broke out,” Netanyahu continued.
 ions of epic proportions. A cease-fire is the only way to ensure their safety.”The post was removed in the morning and no longer appeared on X, only to be replaced a few minutes later by an apology.
 
 ""I was wrong. What I said after the press conference should not have been said and I apologise for it. I fully support all security officials. I support the chief of staff, the commanders, and the soldiers of the IDF (Israeli Army) who are on the front lines and who are fighting for our home. Together we will win,” Netanyahu wrote.
 
 During his press conference with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, member of the Knesset, the Prime Minister admitted the Hamas attack was ""a terrible failure"" for Israel.
 
 ""There has been a terrible failure here and it will be examined to the end. I promise that there will not be a stone left unturned. For now my mission is to save the country and lead the soldiers to total victory over Hamas and the forces of evil,” Netanyahu declared.
 
 Many political analysts in Israel believe that Netanyahu's political career has been seriously compromised by not having been able to ensure the protection of his population - one of his electoral promises.
 
 Thousands loot UN aid warehouses in Gaza as desperation grows and Israel widens ground offensive
 Thousands of people broke into aid warehouses in Gaza to take flour and basic hygiene products, a UN agency said on Sunday, in a mark of growing desperation and the breakdown of public order three weeks into the war between Israel and Gaza's militant Hamas rulers.
 
 Thomas White, director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said the warehouse break-ins were “a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza. People are scared, frustrated and desperate.""
 
 UNRWA provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza. Its schools across the territory have been transformed into packed shelters housing Palestinians displaced by the conflict. Israel has allowed only a small trickle of aid to enter from Egypt, some of which was stored in one of the warehouses that was broken into, UNRWA said.
 
 Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the agency, said the crowds broke into four facilities on Saturday. She said the warehouses did not contain any fuel, which has been in critically short supply since Israel cut off all shipments after the start of the war.

 The Jabalia refugee camp was among the areas hit as the Israeli military called up 300,000 reservists, amid signs it is planning a ground assault into the occupied Palestinian territory.
 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on the UN to immediately intervene to prevent the occurrence of a humanitarian catastrophe due to the “ongoing Israeli aggression, especially in Gaza”.
 Inside Israel, Palestinian fighters were still said to be holed up in several locations, two days after a raid that shattered Israel’s reputation of invincibility.Hamas and Islamic Jihad said on Monday that they were keeping Israeli prisoners safe in accordance with the principles of Islam and asked Tel Aviv to refrain from hitting civilians if they cared about the fate of Israelis in its custody.
 
 However, the former ruled out a prisoner exchange with Israel during hostilities.
 
 Electricity shortages mean residents cannot recharge phones, so are cut off from news of each other and from events, and are unable to pump water into rooftop tanks.
 
 At night the enclave is plunged into total darkness, punctuated by the blasts of air strikes.
 
 As darkness fell, the Israeli bombardment became more aggressive, and witnesses said several Hamas security headquarters and ministries were hit. The strikes destroyed several roads and houses as well.
 
 “Depriving the population in an occupied territory of food and electricity is collective punishment, which is a war crime,” Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
 
 Israel also bombed the headquarters of the private Palestinian Telecommunication Co., which impacted land phone, internet and mobile phone services.s it rained, explosions and lightning lit the skies, and thunder mixed with the sound of the bombings.
 
 Mainstream Palestinian groups said the violence was predictable, with a peace process frozen for nearly a decade and far-right Israeli leaders talking of annexing Palestinian land once and for all.
 
 “The Zionist enemy’s military targeting and bombing of homes inhabited by women and children, mosques and schools in Gaza amount to war crimes and terrorism,” Hamas official Izzat Reshiq said in a statement.
 
 Smouldering Jabalia camp
 
 Palestinians reported receiving calls and mobile phone audio messages from Israeli security officers telling them to leave areas mainly in the northern and eastern territories of Gaza, and warning that the army would operate there.
 
 More than 130,000 Palestinians have fled their homes and are stockpiling supplies amid constant Israeli bombardment.
 
 Footage obtained by Reuters showed dozens of people climbing over collapsed buildings in search of survivors, the air still dusty from impact. Sirens rang out as emergency teams put out cars that had caught fire.
 
 Men clambered on a pancaked building near the Jabalia refugee camp to pull an infant’s tiny body from the rubble, carrying it down through the crowd below amid still-smouldering remains of bombed buildings.
 
 Air strikes have damaged and blocked streets, making it harder for ambulances and rescue vehicles to reach bomb sites, according to residents and medics. Civil defence officials said they could not cope with so many bomb sites, and asked for foreign rescue teams to help it save survivors trapped under rubble.
 
 “Where should we go? Where should we go?” asked 55-year-old Mohammad Brais.
 
 He had fled his home near a possible front line to shelter at his shop – only for that to get hit in one of the hundreds of air and artillery strikes already pounding Gaza.

 As ambulances arrived at a hospital, workers ran out to haul in stretchers bearing the injured. Inside, a man lay next to the shrouded body of his nephew, hysterical with grief, alternately striking the floor and embracing the corpse as he screamed.
 
 Funeral processions wound down Gaza streets. In Rafah, in the south, men strode behind a body being carried on a bier, Palestinian and Hamas flags raised behind.
 
 At the cemetery a family buried Saad Lubbad, a small boy killed in air strikes. His body, wrapped in white, was passed down to be laid on a patterned cloth before burial.
 
 The densely populated enclave’s 2.3 million residents have endured repeated bouts of war and air strikes before. They expect this one to be worse.
 
 “It doesn’t need much thinking about. Israel suffered the biggest loss in its history so you can imagine what it is going to do,” said a resident of Beit Hanoun on Gaza’s northeastern border with Israel.
 
 “I took my family out at sunrise and dozens of other families did the same. Many of us got phone calls, audio messages from Israeli security officers telling us to leave because they will operate there,” he said.
 
 Israeli actions
 
 In a further signal of Israel’s rapid shift to a war footing, a cabinet member from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party said it could set up a national unity government joined by opposition leaders within hours.
 
 Netanyahu told mayors of southern towns hit by Saturday’s surprise assault that Israel’s response would “change the Middle East”.
 
 The announcement that 300,000 reservists had been activated in just two days added to speculation that Israel could be contemplating a ground assault of Gaza, a territory it abandoned nearly two decades ago.
 
 “We have never drafted so many reservists on such a scale,” chief military spokesperson Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari said. “We are going on the offensive.”

 “We have to enter the next phase of the war in the best conditions, not according to what anyone tells us,” spokesman Admiral Daniel Hagari told a press conference.
 
 “From today, we are increasing the strikes and minimising the danger. We will increase the attacks and therefore I call on Gaza City residents to continue moving south for their safety,” Hagari added.
 
 The Israeli military said it aimed to reduce the risks its troops would face as they enter Gaza in the “next phase of the war on Hamas”.
 
 An Israeli siege has cut food, water, electricity and fuel supplies to the densely populated territory of 2.4 million people, sparking fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.
