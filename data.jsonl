{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "We have lost all communication with our Anera Gaza staff members. Most with connections in Gaza have lost complete contact with loved ones and colleagues, as destruction has impacted landline, cellular and internet services. As of this morning, our staff were all accounted for, but this is no longer a guarantee. Over the past 21 days, our 12-member team in Gaza has worked tirelessly to provide for their community by serving meals, delivering medicines to hospitals, and sanitizing shelters to prevent disease spread. While we were never able to properly ensure their safety during this unprecedented bombing campaign, we were always able to verify their locations and provide what little protection we could for them. That is now gone.\nEqually important, essential services such as ambulance dispatches, hospital communications and rescue operations cannot communicate with one another. Even if medical and aid workers can reach those in need there is no way to confirm where they can be taken to provide life-saving care. We only expect these essential services to become even more vital as we receive reports of a potential ground incursion into the northern areas of Gaza.\nThis total blackout comes as Gaza\u2019s health and water sectors have collapsed. Without fuel and due to damage from airstrikes, hospitals and healthcare clinics across Gaza have already been forced to shut down or severely reduce their services. Doctors are making horrifying decisions as to which of their emergency patients they can realistically treat. In Shifa, Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, doctors reported days ago that the hospital is well over capacity, serving some 5,000 patients when it was originally designed to serve 700 people at a time.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "The humanitarian pause, agreed upon by Israel and Hamas, which took effect on 24 November, has been largely maintained for the third consecutive day. This pause has enabled the UN to enhance the delivery of assistance into and across Gaza.\nOn 26 November, aid convoys reached areas north of Wadi Gaza (hereafter: the north). UN agencies and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) distributed 1,062 metric tonnes (MT) of ready-to-eat food to four UNRWA shelters in Jabalia camp; 185 MT of tents and blankets and 890 MT of bottled water to various sites; as well as 164 MT of medical supplies to Al Ahli hospital in Gaza city. The convoys were carefully inspected by Israeli forces deployed at a checkpoint near Wadi Gaza before proceeding northwards.\nThe mission that reached Al Ahli Baptist Hospital evacuated at least 17 patients and wounded people, along with 11 of their companions, to the European Hospital in Khan Younis (in the south). Despite enormous shortages and constraints, Al Ahli remains operational and admitting patients.\nAid distribution in areas south of Wadi Gaza, where the bulk of an estimated 1.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) are currently staying, has been accelerated over the past three days. Key service providers, including hospitals, water and sanitation facilities, and IDP shelters, have continued receiving fuel on a daily basis to operate generators.\nOver the past three days, cooking gas has entered Gaza, contrary to the time before the pause. However, the amounts fall well below the needs. Queues at a filling station in Khan Younis have reportedly extended for about 2 kilometres, with people waiting at them overnight. Meanwhile, reports indicate that people are burning doors and window frames to cook.\nOn 26 November, 17 hostages held in Gaza and 39 Palestinian detainees held in Israeli prisons were released. The released hostages included 13 Israelis \u2013 four women and nine children \u2013 and four foreign nationals. Among the Palestinian detainees were 39 boys. Since the start of the pause, 39 Israelis, 117 Palestinians and 19 foreign nationals have been released.\nBetween 25 and 26 November, Israeli forces in the West Bank killed seven Palestinians, including four children, bringing to 230 the Palestinian death toll since 7 October; 222 by Israeli forces and eight by settlers.\nHostilities and casualties (Gaza Strip)\n\nSince the humanitarian pause entered into force at 7:00 on 24 November, airstrikes, shelling, and ground clashes have reportedly ceased.\nIn one incident involving Israeli tank fire east of the Al -Maghazi refugee camp, in the Middle Area, one Palestinian man was reportedly killed and another injured; the circumstances remain unclear.\nAccording to the Government Media Office, as of 18:00 on 23 November, more than 14,800 people have been killed in Gaza, including about 6,000 children and 4,000 women. This office, which is under the de facto authorities in Gaza, has been reporting casualties since the Ministry of Health in Gaza stopped doing so on 11 November, following the collapse of services and communications at hospitals in the north.\nAs of 18:00 on 25 November, 75 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the Israeli ground operations, according to official Israeli sources.\nDisplacement (Gaza Strip)\n\nUpon the entry into force of the pause, Israeli forces announced that the movement of people from the south to the north is forbidden.\nOn 26 November, the Israeli military continued calling and exerting pressure on residents of the north to leave southwards through a \u201ccorridor\u201d along the main traffic artery, Salah Ad Deen Road, between 9:00 and 16:00. OCHA\u2019s monitoring during the day estimated that less than 400 people crossed south.\nThe OCHA monitoring team observed many people with injuries crossing through the \u201ccorridor\u201d on 26 November. A man interviewed by OCHA at the crossing point revealed that they had to leave Kamal Odwan hospital, in the north, after it was hit the night prior to the pause.\nIsraeli forces had been arresting some people moving through the \u201ccorridor.\u201d IDPs interviewed by OCHA reported that Israeli forces had established an unstaffed checkpoint where people are directed from a distance to pass through two structures, where a surveillance system is thought to be installed. IDPs are ordered to show their IDs and undergo into a facial recognition scan.\nThe movement of unaccompanied children and separated families has also been observed in the \u201ccorridor\u201d. Humanitarian actors are assisting these children, including through registration of cases. However, urgent measures are required to augment the presence of child protection teams in shelters; enhancing registration efficiency and addressing the specific needs of these children.\nThe number of displaced people continues to increase. Over 1.7 million people in Gaza, or nearly 80 per cent of the population, are estimated to be internally displaced. Of them, nearly 927,000 IDPs are sheltering in 99 facilities in the south.\nDue to the overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions at UNRWA shelters, there have been significant increases in some communicable diseases and conditions such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections and hygiene-related conditions like lice.\nHumanitarian Access (Gaza Strip)\n\nThe total number of trucks that entered Gaza on 26 November is unclear at the time of writing as many continued to be processed during the evening hours. On 25 November, 200 trucks were dispatched from Nitzana.\nThe Rafah crossing with Egypt has been also open on 26 November for the exit of wounded and sick people and dual and foreign nationals, as well as for the entry of Gaza residents who had been stranded in Egypt.\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel, which prior to the hostilities was the main entry point for goods, has remained closed.\nElectricity\n\nSince 11 October, the Gaza Strip has been under an electricity blackout, after the Israeli authorities cut off the electricity supply, and fuel reserves for Gaza\u2019s sole power plant depleted.\nHealth care, including attacks (Gaza Strip)\n\nOn 26 November, a joint UN convoy collected 7,600 doses of vaccines for various diseases from the Ministry of Health warehouse in Gaza city and transported them to southern Gaza. The need for this transfer arose due to the lack of refrigeration capacity in the north. After thorough inspections to ensure their validity, the vaccines will be utilized to enhance routine immunization, which has been hampered by a shortage of supplies and ongoing hostilities. As of 25 November, 1,205 children were vaccinated at seven health centres according to the national vaccination programme, bringing the total number to 11,622 since 4 November.\nKamal Odwan hospital in Jabalia, one of the four small hospitals still operational in the north, is facing immense pressure. Supplies and medical staff are particularly urgent in the fields of obstetrics, paediatrics, neonatology, surgery, and orthopaedics. Eighty patients require immediate transfer to a better equipped facility in the south for their survival. On 22 November, the vicinity of the hospital was heavily bombarded, reportedly resulting in dozens of fatalities and injuries; many of the latter are still waiting to receive treatment.\nOf the 11 medical facilities in the south, eight are currently functional. The bed capacity across Gaza has declined from 3,500 prior to the war to 1,400 as of 20 November, amid a surge in those seeking treatment. Only one of the currently functional hospitals in the south has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nAs of 25 November, nine (out of 22) UNRWA health centres were still operational in the south, recording 10,802 patient visits.\nWater and sanitation (Gaza Strip)\n\nSince the start of the humanitarian pause, UNRWA has collected and disposed hundreds of tons of solid waste that had been accumulating inside and outside its shelters in the south, benefiting about 1 million people.\nOn 26 November, technicians visited water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities in the north, carrying out an initial assessment of the damage sustained, and the repairs needed to reactivate them.\nUNRWA continued delivering fuel to the Gaza\u2019s main water utility, which in turn distributed it to water and sanitation facilities in the south: two seawater desalination plants, 79 water wells, 15 water pumping stations, 18 sewage pumping stations, and one wastewater treatment plant. Supply of potable water in the south via two pipelines coming from Israel has continued.\nOn 26 November, the first delivery of bottled water reached IDP shelters in the north since the Israeli ground operation began. Partners were previously unable to reach the northern areas due to intense ground operations and lack of fuel for track distribution. However, concerns about dehydration and waterborne diseases persist due to water consumption from unsafe sources, as the water desalination plant and the Israeli pipeline supplying water to the north are not functioning.\nFood security\n\nThe ready-to-eat food distributed at UNRWA shelters in Jabalia, in the north, on 26 November, included about 7.6 metric tons of high-energy biscuits provided by the World Food Programme (WFP). This covers the minimal daily food intake for 23,616 people for one day.\nSince 24 November, WFP has provided essential food assistance to 110,000 people in UNRWA shelters and host communities through the distribution of bread, food parcels, and electronic vouchers. Since 25 November, one WFP bakery has resumed operations on an ad-hoc basis allowing the provision of bread to about 90,000 people in UN shelters in the south.\nFood prices in the market have experienced an unprecedented surge. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, during October, food and beverages prices increased by 10 per cent; with vegetables increasing by 32 per cent, wheat flour by 65 per cent, and mineral water by 100 per cent.\nDespite the increase in food aid through Rafah, many people still lack food and fuel to cook. No additional bakeries are operational, due to the lack of fuel, water, and wheat flour, and structural damage. Wheat flour is reportedly no longer available in the market. Food Security Cluster members have raised serious concerns about the nutritional status of people, especially lactating women, and children. This is heightened in the north, which is more difficult to reach.\nAlso in the north, livestock is facing starvation and the risk of death due to shortage of fodder and water. Crops are being increasingly abandoned and damaged due to lack of fuel required to pump irrigation water.\nAcross Gaza, farmers have been slaughtering their animals due to the immediate need for food and the lack of fodder to keep them alive. This practice poses an additional threat to food security as it leads to the depletion of productive assets.\nHostilities and casualties (Israel)\n\nOn 25 November, no rocket fire from Gaza towards Israel was reported. In total, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli authorities, the vast majority on 7 October. As of 20 November, the names of most of these fatalities have been released, including 859 civilians and police officers. Of those whose ages have been provided, 33 are children.\nFollowing the release of 17 hostages on 26 November, 178 people remain captive in Gaza, including Israelis and foreign nationals, according to the Israeli authorities. Before the pause, four civilian hostages had been released by Hamas, one Israeli soldier had been rescued by Israeli forces, and three bodies of hostages had reportedly been retrieved by Israeli forces. On 25 November, the UN reiterated its call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.\nViolence and casualties (West Bank)\n\nOn 25 and 26 November, Israeli forces shot and killed seven Palestinians, including four children during Israeli forces operations. The deadliest incident, which lasted for ten hours, took place in Jenin Refugee Camp, and resulted in five Palestinians killed. The operation involved armed clashes with Palestinians, and airstrikes, resulting in extensive infrastructure and residential damage. According to medical sources, during the operation, Israeli forces impeded the work of paramedics, denied access to two hospitals, and arrested two people injured in one of the hospitals. Another Palestinian boy was killed by Israeli forces in Al Bireh (Ramallah) during stone throwing confrontations. Another Palestinian man was killed while inside his vehicle during an operation carried out by undercover Israeli forces in Yatma (Nablus). No Israeli casualties were reported.\nSince 7 October, 222 Palestinians, including 58 children, have been killed by Israeli forces; and an additional eight, including one child, have been killed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Four Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians.\nAbout 66 per cent of the fatalities since 7 October have occurred during confrontations that followed Israeli search-and-arrest operations, primarily in Jenin and Tulkarm governorates; 24 per cent have been in the context of demonstrations concerning Gaza; seven per cent have been killed while attacking or allegedly attacking Israeli forces or settlers; two per cent have been killed in settler attacks against Palestinians; and one per cent during punitive demolitions.\nSince 7 October, Israeli forces have injured 2,904 Palestinians, including at least 369 children, over half of them in the context of demonstrations. An additional 73 Palestinians have been injured by settlers and 18 others either by forces or settlers. Some 33 per cent of those injuries have been caused by live ammunition.\nOn 25 November, three settler attacks resulted in damage to property and injuries. In one incident, a group of settlers accompanied by Israeli forces broke into Burqa village (Nablus), which was followed by confrontations with Palestinians; Israeli forces opened live fire, injuring one Palestinian. In another two incidents, according to Palestinian eyewitnesses, a group of Israeli settlers vandalized 155 olive trees in the outskirt of Immatin (Qalqiliya) and Qaryut (Nablus).\nSince 7 October, OCHA has recorded 284 settler attacks against Palestinians, resulting in Palestinian casualties (34 incidents), damage to Palestinian-owned property (212 incidents), or both casualties and damage to property (38 incidents). This reflects a daily average of almost six incidents, compared with three since the beginning of the year. Over one-third of these incidents included threats with firearms, including shootings. In nearly half of all incidents, Israeli forces were either accompanying or actively supporting the attackers.\nDisplacement (West Bank)\n\nSince 7 October, at least 143 Palestinian households comprising 1,014 people, including 388 children, have been displaced amid settler violence and access restrictions. The displaced households are from 15 herding/Bedouin communities.\nAdditionally, 181 Palestinians, including 93 children, have been displaced since 7 October following demolitions in Area C and East Jerusalem, due to lack of permits; and 52 Palestinians, including 25 children, have been displaced following punitive demolitions.\nFunding\n\nAs of 25 November, Member States have disbursed US$256.4 million against the updated Flash Appeal launched by the UN and its partners to implement its response plan in support of 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 500,000 in the West Bank. This constitutes about 21 per cent of the $1.2 billion requested. An additional $250 million has been pledged by 23 November. Private donations are collected through the Humanitarian Fund.\nHUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND RESPONSES: 13-19 November\n\nHealth\n\nOn 18 November, WHO led a joint UN team that visited Shifa Hospital, in Gaza city to conduct a rapid situational analysis, assess medical priorities, and establish logistics options for the evacuation of patients.\n\nSince 1 November, Cluster partners have delivered the following items across Gaza:\n\nvarious medical supplies to ten hospitals and the ambulances;\nassistive and mobility devices, wound dressing kits and\u202ffirst aid kits to 805 people;\n87 reproductive health kits to hospitals to enable safe deliveries;\ncash transfers to 724 vulnerable women in Gaza, including pregnant and lactating women, breast cancer patients, and survivors of gender-based violence (GBV);\n600 postpartum kits;\n900 family hygiene kits distributed in one IDP shelter in An-Nusseirat and 120 host community shelters;\n1,070 dignity kits to women staying in IDP shelters.\nDuring the same period, there have been an average of 10,000 consultations a day at mobile primary healthcare providers in shelters; 2,925 children were vaccinated after this service resumed in November; 132\u202fwound dressing\u202fand 60 physiotherapy sessions were\u202fprovided.\u202fLimited mental health and psychosocial services are being provided by partners, mainly in shelters. Cluster partners are also working to strengthen disease surveillance and early warning systems.\n\nMain factors that have been impeding operations include limited access to the north; shortage of fuel, medical supplies, water, food, and other essential supplies; displacement of partners, their staff and families; and overcrowding in IDP shelters. NGO partners have experienced difficulties with their logistics capacity in Egypt. So far, only 19 per cent of funding required to respond has been committed.\n\nProtection\n\nMine contamination is already widespread and poses devastating risks for people in Gaza. Despite challenges, during the reporting period, 18 Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) focal points were deployed in UNRWA shelters in the south and will begin awareness raising. The UN Mine Action Service is developing a training course for 20 UNRWA staff in Khan Younis and Rafah. Planning for the expansion of risk education outreach in non-UNRWA shelters is underway. One NGO also reached 4,900 people with risk education about unexploded ordnances and sent 500,000 SMS related messages.\n\nA mapping of GBV-related service providers and responders has been completed. The main priority in this context is to reduce overcrowding in shelters, which increase stressors, reduce privacy, and exacerbate risks of violence towards women and girls. Of concern is the significant gap in dignity kits supplies and access for women of the reproductive age. There are 3,000 kits in Egypt ready to move into Gaza once approved, and a further 6,000 in the pipeline. Funding is urgently needed to meet the soaring needs of women and girls in Gaza.\n\nCluster partners are assessing needs and available supply of assistive devices and kits in UNRWA southern governorate shelters. While demand for assistive devices continues to increase, the remaining stockpiles in northern Gaza are inaccessible. Further supplies are being procured and in the pipeline via Egypt. Significant damage to rehabilitation facilities has cut critical services.\n\nMental health care needs are skyrocketing, especially for persons with disabilities, children, and those with pre-existing complex conditions. However, many services have been destroyed and many staff are unable to work. Only limited psychosocial support (PSS) services and psychological first aid is being provided in some shelters across Gaza where protection actors are sheltering and have capacity to respond.\n\nDespite extreme overcrowding at shelters, UNRWA has been able to provide some recreational activities, PSS support, and mine risk awareness sessions. They have also conducted child protection assessments and been assessing how to implement activities with children and young adults and scale up these activities across all their shelters.\n\nFood security\n\nSince 7 October, the World Food Programme (WFP) has reached an estimate of 550,300 IDPs in UN shelters with daily fresh bread, canned food, or date bars. Additionally, food parcels were distributed to 38,659 displaced people in host communities to support their food needs over a 15-day period. In addition, WFP has provided cash-based transfers. In November, redemption rates decreased compared with October, due to the closure of the majority of WFP-contracted shops, stock depletion, or connectivity disturbances preventing assistance activities across Gaza. WFP is piloting a programme relying on the existing electronic voucher platform to distribute food parcels at shops and partner distribution points. Overall, 73.5 WPF truckloads entered Gaza carrying 1,296 metric tons of food assistance. This falls short of meeting the necessary needs of food in the Strip.\n\nIn addition to in-kind food distribution, UNRWA has been distributing flour to bakeries for producing bread for distribution. To date, 88 UNRWA trucks containing food entered Gaza, carrying 1,760 metric tons of food assistance.\n\nTwenty international and local NGOs have jointly reached 1,9 million people since the beginning of the war (cumulative). Partners have used different modalities, including food parcels, hot meals and e-vouchers\n\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)\n\nDuring the reporting period, WASH Cluster partners delivered the following items. In the absence of safe access to the north, distribution has been made possible in areas south of Wadi Gaza only.\n\nSome 165 cubic metres of bottled water at IDP centres, addressing drinkable water needs of about 100,000 people.\nSome 1,733 cubic metres of water through water trucking for hosting communities and IDP centres from the municipal and private desalination plants in the south, addressing the drinking and domestic water needs of 300,000 people (less than 5 litres a day per person).\nFour cleaning kits for four IDP centres in Rafah, hosting about 10,000 people.\nSome 6,500 family hygiene kits for IDPs (3,800 in the north and 2,700 in the south), serving about 40,000 people.\nAdditional sanitary units for UNRWA IDPs.\nThe situation in the north is of extreme concern and the highest priority for the WASH Cluster: the water desalination plant and the Israeli pipeline are not functioning, while there has been no distribution of bottled water among IDPs accommodated in shelters, raising grave concerns about dehydration and waterborne diseases due to water consumption from unsafe sources.\n\nThe average water production from all Gaza water sources does not exceed 12 per cent of its usual capacity before the escalation. WASH Cluster issued a document outlines the Water Supply and Fuel Relationship.\n\nWASH partners have secured US$6 million, representing some 15.6 per cent of the need for immediate response to the current situation.\n\nShelter and Non-Food Items (NFI)\n\nDuring the reporting period, Shelter Cluster partners delivered the following items. In the absence of safe access to the north, distribution has been made possible in areas south of Wadi Gaza only.\n\n7,600 bedding sets (blankets, mattresses, and mats),\n2,000 kitchen sets,\n2000 washing kits,\n370 tarps, 1000 dignity kits in public schools and buildings, including hospitals,\n350 tents donated to UNRWA to decongest overcrowded shelters.\nDue to limited supplies, cluster partners only covered less than 7 per cent of the estimated Shelter and NFIs needs.\n\nThere is still a major gap in shelter winterization materials and essential NFIs, including sealing off kits for damaged houses and creating additional living spaces; a high shortage in bedding sets, including mattresses and blankets to cover the needs of the IDPs in different settings, including UNRWA shelters; and winterized tents to protect homeless IDPs from harsh weather conditions.\u202f\n\nEducation\n\nSince 7 October, eight Education Cluster partners have reached 45,867 students and teachers. The main deliverables included emergency learning and recreational supplies (42,533 people reached), psychosocial support (30,018 reached), and recreational activities (8,082 reached). The response has been focusing on Khan Younis, Rafah, and Middle governorates, as North Gaza and Gaza governorates are inaccessible.\n\nLogistics\n\n16 November marked one month since the activation of the Palestine Logistics Cluster. The Palestine \u2013 Gaza Response Operation Overview and One Month Infographic are available on the dedicated operation webpage.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the entry of limited amounts of fuel for UNRWA has been coordinated, for the first time since the start of hostilities, with regular daily deliveries expected from 19 November. fewer trucks entered Gaza for several days during the week due to a backlog of aid from previous days, shortage of fuel and a communication shutdown leading to an inability to effectively manage or coordinate humanitarian aid convoys under these circumstances.\n\nThree staff members based in Gaza joined the Logistics Cluster to support\u202fUNRWA, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and a partner NGO\u202fin receiving shipments crossing from Rafah.\u202f\n\nThe Logistics Cluster has also conducted a Storage Needs and Capacity Survey in Gaza and Egypt. Results show that\u202fabout 165,000\u202fcubic metres of storage space is available inside Gaza, the majority of which is in Gaza city and Rafah. Sixteen organizations require storage inside Gaza, while 14 organizations require storage in Egypt.\u202fThe Logistics Cluster will continue following up with the organizations to ensure needs are met.\n\nEmergency Telecommunications\n\nThe Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) coordination team continues to engage all parties \u2015 the Egyptian Red Crescent, OCHA, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and the Egyptian authorities \u2015 to fast-track the importation process of telecommunications equipment through either Egypt or Israel into Gaza. Liaison with OCHA continues the importation of equipment into Gaza via Israel. To coordinate a collective approach among partners for the importation of equipment, a survey was launched on 16 November and is currently ongoing. A security communications services implementation plan is being developed.\n\nReliable communications networks are needed to enable humanitarians to stay connected in high-risk situations, restore security communications networks for UN staff, and coordinate response activities."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the statement true?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "true."}]}

Two of the family\u2019s children were among 140 others who were injured. In total, three Americans were among the dead.\n\nThe terrorist was a resident of the West Bank town of Aqaba. His remains were eventually handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nThe bombmaker, Abdullah Barghouti, was commander of the West Bank branch of the Hamas Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades Military Wing. In 2003, he received the longest ever sentence in Israeli history \u2013 67 life terms plus 5,200 years behind bars \u2013 for involvement in the Sbarro and a series of other notable deadly attacks. The PA has paid the notorious felon a \u2018pension\u2019 since his conviction as part of its \u201cPay to Slay\u201d program that awards payments to Palestinian terrorists and their families dependent on the severity of the crimes against Israelis.\n\nFemale accomplice Ahlam Tamimi, a Jordanian and the first woman to join Hamas, was given 16 life sentences in 2003 for her role in the Sbarro bombing, including having driven al-Masri to the scene of the crime. She returned to the Hashemite Kingdom after being freed in 2011 along with 1,026 other Palestinians in a prisoner exchange with Hamas for the return of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.  The United States has long sought Tamimi\u2019s extradition on charges of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against Americans; a request so far rejected by Jordan\u2019s High Court.\n\nThe attack was occurred during the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising between September 2000 and January 2005, that claimed the lives of at least 1,010 Israelis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the statement true?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "false."}]}

She wears braces, an assortment of loose-fitting T-shirts, and denim button-downs. Her live reports vary in tone. In a recent video, she calmly explains what Gaza even is, geographically speaking.

I have witnessed friends who thought the issue was complicated realize it isn\u2019t.\n Since the assault began, I\u2019ve spent my days yelling, crying, sharing, fundraising, and continuing on as normal. Bouts of activism interspersed with the daily life of a working mother in Brooklyn. I\u2019ve taught my writing classes as usual without once mentioning Palestine. I\u2019ve walked by the doxing vans and tried to shake off my disgust before entering the classroom. I\u2019ve read at fundraisers and found my voice shaking, eyes burning, even though I\u2019d chosen to read something with levity. Pain in writing can be hilarious, the author Geoff Dyer once told me. As a Palestinian, I\u2019ve held on to that. I\u2019ve gone to action-oriented meetings to organize. I\u2019ve also gone to a dog Halloween-costume contest with my wife and our 1-year-old daughter. I\u2019ve taken her to Tunes for Tykes. That I can grieve and protest, attend vigils and fundraisers, and still plan a birthday party for my daughter is a duality that is impossible to sit with. \u201cEverything normal right now is obscene,\u201d I heard Israeli journalist Amira Hass say early on in the war, and it\u2019s true. Even sitting down to articulate this moment feels obscene.\n As Palestinians in the diaspora, many of us have tried to use our position of straddling two worlds to communicate across cultural lines. That\u2019s what brought me to writing in the first place \u2014 first to journalism, then to essays and fiction, where I could subversively get people to identify with characters who shared the same woes but happened to be Palestinian. Now, finally, those inside have a platform. They are the real-life characters. This time, the words aren\u2019t mine to speak.\n \u201cReporting and posting about what\u2019s happening in Gaza, Palestine feels pointless,\u201d Plestia writes on day 37, having regained access to her account after two days without it. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m posting movie scenes for people to watch, and whenever they get bored they watch something else.\u201d It\u2019s a good point, one that instills shame. At what stage do we become voyeurs? Are people just watching and not witnessing? To watch is to consume; to witness is to acknowledge, to bestow some degree of legitimacy. But what does it do to see it? Is empathy ever enough? \u201cCompassion is an unstable emotion,\u201d Susan Sontag wrote. \u201cIt needs to be translated into action, or it withers.\u201d Earlier, I went to share a post and stopped myself. I thought of Motaz\u2019s apology, his shame at filming Gazans in their worst moments. Will a picture of a girl who has lost 60 family members and the use of her legs inspire only empathy? Will it change anything, or will the bombing just continue, the number of orphans and murdered doctors keep rising?\n My uncle\u2019s Gazan wife once told me that during Gaza\u2019s many wars, people would often go to the beach after a bombing to celebrate the fact that they were still alive. Joy is its own form of resistance. It allows people to sustain. I find myself looking for any signs of normalcy among Bisan, Plestia, and Motaz\u2019s images. A makeshift birthday party atop the rubble. Laughter in the long lines of exodus. Sometimes, all I can find is a sunny blue sky. Gaza has long been called an open-air prison, a description I bristle at despite its fully land- and sea-locked status. Its people are not criminals, and to call it a prison is to suggest they deserve what they get. They lead big lives in spite of confinement. Before the war, each of them had a life that, while difficult and dehumanizing, contained joy. In a video from October 4, days before the war began, Bisan is by the beach, upbeat bistro music playing in the background. There is footage of her riding a Jeep through the desert, of Motaz dancing at a graduation, of Plestia sitting beside an electric fireplace in Gaza City, smiling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the statement true?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "true."}]}
